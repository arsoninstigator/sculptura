# sculptura ☆.ᐟ

sculptura is a wip fully **open-source** and customized budget 3d printer made by me (@anne on slack) **from scratch** for decorative items :D

## planning

### ⋆ overview
- inspired by the ender 3 v3 se
- costs <250$ excluding costs of filament (im working with a bambu lab a1 mini)
- aims for better stability, improved filament grip and reduced slipping

### ⋆ desired specifications
- build volume: ~220x220x250mm
- running klipper
- multicolor
- prints pla, pla+, petg, tpu & nylon
- more suitable ready-to-use prints for functional, creative and decorative pieces as opposed to prints for industrial applications

## bill of materials
im currently researching stuff to make a comprehensive bom with everything i would require to make my printer come to life

## daily log
### ⋆ day one
time taken - 3 hours for research + ½ hour for readme
