# sculptura ☆.ᐟ

sculptura is a wip fully **open-source** and customized budget 3d printer made by me (@anne on slack) **from scratch** for decorative items :D

## planning

### ⋆ overview
- build volume: ~220x220x250mm
- multi-color & silent operation
- doesn't start on fire
- costs <250$ excluding costs of filament (im working with a bambu lab a1 mini)
- designed for printing functional decorative pieces over the industrial applications

### ⋆ desired specifications
- rigid braced aluminum frame + improved stability (wrt ender3 v3se)
- higher print resolution (0.1mm layer height capability)
- prints pla (silk, matte, wood, marble, metal-infused), transparent petg, tpu
- cartesian (since we need precise extrusion control and cooling rather than raw speed)
- smooth motion system + linear rails (if budget permits)
- runs klipper


## bill of materials
im currently researching stuff to make a comprehensive bom with everything i would require to make my printer come to life

## daily log
### ⋆ day one
time taken - 3 hours for research + ½ hour for readme
