                            <br>
                            i’m drawn to white collar crime because it sits at the intersection of finance, technology, and justice, things i am the most passionate about. i'm especially interested in white collar criminal defense and navigating the gray areas where legality, intent, and perception collide. defending clients in these cases means unpacking complex financial or technical systems, challenging assumptions, and building narratives that make sense of ambiguity. the field is intellectually demanding, ethically nuanced, and deeply strategic, everything that i find compelling in the law.
                            <br><br>
                            i enjoy exploring intellectual property law in my free time — especially picking on cases where it collides with media and entertainment. i’m fascinated by how ideas, creativity, and ownership intersect, and how the law shapes what gets protected, shared, or challenged. it’s a space where culture, tech, and legal strategy are constantly in conversation and the recent bartz vs anthropic decision especially piqued my interest. i've also been curious about how legal systems are adapting to emerging technologies and the rise of cybercrimes — especially those with gendered dynamics, where questions of power, privacy, and accountability collide.

<!-- 
                            i've always been fascinated by language — its structure, origins, and quirks. i pick up foreign languages i’ll probably never use, spoken in countries i’ll probably never visit, just because they’re interesting. i’m equally into dialects, extinct tongues, and the secret codes tucked into ancient scripts.

                            i got into entrepreneurship early with a high school jewelry design business — working with cad modeling, resin printing, and metal casting — and i’ve been lurking in startup circles ever since (average wannabe y combinator-er).

                            i have a soft spot for greek mythology (especially the catastrophically dramatic gods), regularly take up mildly unhinged creative hobbies, and have an alarming knowledge of spycraft and tradecraft techniques for someone with zero actual espionage experience.
