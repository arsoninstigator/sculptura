                             i would add that cookie cutter table of skills over here but it's never going to be up-to-date bcs iâ€™m always chasing whatever tools or frameworks will help me build smarter and forgetting things i havent touched in a bit. i start overambitious projects, abandon old repos like side quests, and dive into unfamiliar tech stacks that end with me obsessively trying to organize the chaos with color-coded mind maps. through it all, iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in full stack web development (mostly front-end), hardware prototyping and pcb design, ui/ux design, and mechanical cad, by building and contributing to a range of open-source technical projects.

                            outside of tech, i got into applied mathematics and statistics out of a need to make sense of messy, unpredictable dataâ€”searching for patterns and explanations where none were obvious. what began with simple charts and visualizations grew into a deeper interest in modeling, inference, and data-driven thinking fueling my random late night deep dives.
