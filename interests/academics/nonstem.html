                            im planning to dive into <strong><span style="color: #c6c5c6">white collar criminal defense</span></strong> after law school â€” think <em>suits</em> meets <em>how to get away with murder</em>, but with more footnotes.  and am deeply curious about the psychology behind male violence against women & girls: the patterns, the power dynamics, what drives it all and the laws and regulations combatting it.

                            <br>
                            iâ€™m drawn to white collar crime because it sits at the intersection of finance, technology, and justice, things i am the most passionate about. i'm especially interested in white collar criminal defense and navigating the gray areas where legality, intent, and perception collide. defending clients in these cases means unpacking complex financial or technical systems, challenging assumptions, and building narratives that make sense of ambiguity. the field is intellectually demanding, ethically nuanced, and deeply strategic, everything that i find compelling in the law.
                            <br><br>
                            i enjoy exploring intellectual property law in my free time â€” especially picking on cases where it collides with media and entertainment. iâ€™m fascinated by how ideas, creativity, and ownership intersect, and how the law shapes what gets protected, shared, or challenged. itâ€™s a space where culture, tech, and legal strategy are constantly in conversation and the recent bartz vs anthropic decision especially piqued my interest. 
                            <br><br>
                            since i routinely keep up with global politics, i've been curious about how legal systems are adapting to emerging technologies and the rise of cybercrimes â€” especially those with gendered dynamics, where questions of power, privacy, and accountability collide. being in feminist spaces often makes me want to dig deeper into the psychology behind male violence against women and girls â€” the patterns, the power plays, what drives it â€” and how the law tries (and often fails) to stop it. iâ€™d want to prosecute in those cases, but iâ€™m more drawn to defense work in most other areas of criminal law.

                            i've always been fascinated by language â€” its structure, origins, and quirks. i pick up foreign languages iâ€™ll probably never use, spoken in countries iâ€™ll probably never visit, just because theyâ€™re interesting. iâ€™m equally into dialects, extinct tongues, and the secret codes tucked into ancient scripts.

                            my interest in economics and finance isn't new but i only got into entrepreneurship early in high school with a jewelry design business â€” working with cad modeling, resin printing, and metal casting â€” and iâ€™ve been lurking in startup circles ever since (average wannabe y combinator-er).

                            my mom categorizes recreationally reading autopsy reports as "strange" and finds my interest in forensic science "odd". i chose to blame abby scuito and temperance brennan for my love for toxicology, ballistics, blood spatter patterns, weapon mechanics and basically anything that explains how things break, why they fail, or who made them fail. she also says that i have an alarming knowledge of spycraft and tradecraft techniques for someone with zero actual espionage experience, but i swear my fixation on death is totally normal and fine. totally fine. academically fine.
