                            <br /><br />
                            i'm a full-time nerd for linguistics, economics, forensic sciences (including toxicology, ballistics, blood spatter patterns, weapon mechanics) and whatever language i’m in the mood for learning that month. i have a soft spot for greek mythology (especially the messy gods), picking up mildly unhinged creative hobbies for no reason and diving into spycraft tradecraft techniques :3
                            <br /><br />
                            when i’m not buried in case law, i’m probably playing video games (aka designing fake rooms and crafting perfect little digital avatar alter egos), reading feminist theory like it’s fiction, cyberstalking strangers on linkedin, or arguing over politics (respectfully) on the internet. <br />

                            i want to design robots, paint them pastel, and give them names like kevin. i want to write academic papers by day and host chaotic craft nights with glitter and soldering irons. ultimately, i want to design functional art and chaotic good inventions.

                                one thing about me is i genuinely enjoy putting myself through the emotional chaos of slow burn fics where the characters take forever (if ever) to get together. i’ll happily read 200k words of pining, miscommunication, and maybe one lingering glance by chapter 37. <br>

                                canon means nothing to me—i don’t care if you wrote the book, i know that character better. and somehow i always end up reading unfinished fics from 2016 that end on a cliffhanger and ruin my week.

                                the funniest part? the second the characters finally get together, i lose all interest and move onto the next book that gives me that same familiar, gut-wrenching ache i will eat up every single time.
